# A Pathway for Creating Data Schemas

Schemas are a way to document your data and help make it more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Creating a schema is a process of continuous improvement. You don't need to create the most perfect and complete schema at the beginning. Instead, follow this pathway to gradual improvement where each step produces something usable for researchers.

# 2. What is a Schema

[Learn what a schema is](what_is_a_schema.md) and how it can apply to your research.

# 3. Write Your First Schema

Following these instructions(link to come) you will download the schema template (an Excel file), and using your dataset you will enter in minimal schema information in this first iteration.

## What can you do with this schema?
* With this Excel document that you create you can store it beside (but separate from) your dataset. 
* You can share the Excel schema file when you share data.
* If your lab or collaborators use similar data you can collaborate together to define and write a schema and save it in a shared folder.
* IF you are a lab manager or leader you can request or require your students to use standard lab schemas in their research.

This first Excel schema will meet a lot of user needs, but how can you be sure you are all using the *same* version? This is something that is addressed with the OCA schema standard and the use of SAID identifiers.

# 4. What is the Semantic Engine

Read our [introduction to schemas and the Semantic Engine](semantic_engine.md).

# 5. Create an OCA Schema from Your Template

Using the Excel schema that you created when you wrote your first schema, you can use the OCA parser to generate the OCA Schema Bundle.

Your Excel schema is still a human readable version of the schema, but the OCA Schema Bundle is a machine actionable version of your schema and includes special SAID identifiers for schema version.

# 6. Read about SAID Identifiers

Read about [Identifiers and SAID identifiers](identifiers_and_saids.md) and how they relate to the OCA schema.

# 7. Deposit your Schema in a Repository

# 8. Reference your Schema in Your Documentation

# 9. Create a Data Entry Sheet in Excel

# 10. Add Format and Data Validation

# 11. Add Drop Down Menu Choices
